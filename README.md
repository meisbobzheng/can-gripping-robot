ROBOT X Y Z MAX COORDS AND STUFF

Range for all coords: -.75 to .75

+X is right of robot ?
+Y is forward of robot ?
+Z is above robot

Z = .2 is a good height off ground to be grabbing a can.

X,Y .5 range around the robot would be a good maximum range for cans to be placed on table ?

Base: (0,0,0) coordinates is roughly where the "-" is in the name on the robot

Questions for Prof:
1. Why is y = .4, y = -.4 seem like the same position?
2. Where to place camera? (Above, on end effector.)
   - If it's above, we can't see what kind of can it is - would need 2 cameras?
    - But x,y, pos would be much easier to calculate from above.
